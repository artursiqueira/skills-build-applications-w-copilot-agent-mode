# My Agent

I'm working on a GitHub Copilot course exercise where I need to build a fitness tracking application called "OctoFit" using agent mode. Here's the context:

EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS:
- Build a fitness goals and progress tracking application
- Use GitHub Copilot agent mode (not just regular chat)
- Work in a branch called "build-octofit-app" (already created)
- The app should track fitness goals and progress

CURRENT SETUP:
- I'm in a GitHub Codespace with VS Code
- Working in the "build-octofit-app" branch
- There's a docs folder with sample application context for Copilot
- This is part of the "Build Applications with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode" course

WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO:
Please help me build a complete fitness tracking application (OctoFit) that includes:

1. **Core Features:**
   - User can set fitness goals (weight loss, muscle gain, cardio targets, etc.)
   - Track daily/weekly progress
   - View progress charts/statistics
   - Set and track different types of workouts
   - Calculate BMI and fitness metrics

2. **Technical Requirements:**
   - Use modern web technologies (React/Vue/vanilla JS - your choice)
   - Include proper file structure
   - Add styling (CSS/Tailwind - your choice)
   - Include data persistence (localStorage or simple JSON)
   - Write clean, commented code
   - Include a README with setup instructions

3. **Agent Mode Expectations:**
   - Create the entire application structure from scratch
   - Set up all necessary files and folders
   - Install any required dependencies
   - Write and test the code
   - Handle any errors that come up during development
   - Provide terminal commands as needed

4. **Deliverables:**
   - Complete working fitness tracking web application
   - Professional UI/UX design
   - Responsive layout
   - Documentation
   - All files properly organized

Please start by analyzing the workspace, understanding the context from the docs folder, and then building the complete OctoFit fitness tracking application step by step. Use your agent mode capabilities to handle file creation, dependency management, testing, and any troubleshooting needed.

Begin now and build me an amazing fitness tracking app! 🏋️‍♂️💪
